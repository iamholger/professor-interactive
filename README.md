# professor

Jupyter notebook replacement for prof2-I, the interactive parametrisation explorer (professor.hepforge.org).

Example parametrisation files can be found in the repository.

Launch Binder, run the notebook until the upload button appears, select professor >=2.2.0 parametriasation file,
load rest of notebook. The sliders can be used to play with the parameters,the dropdown list allows to switch to
another histogram of interest.

Many thanks to Lukas Heinrich!!!
